# TaskTrack

TaskTrack is a to-do task tracking app that allows users to organize their tasks into projects. With TaskTrack, users can easily manage their tasks, add project categories, set due dates, prioritize tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The app is designed to provide a streamlined and intuitive user experience for efficient task management.

## Features

- **Project Management**: Users can create different projects such as "Birthday," "Work stuff," "Party," or any other category they need to organize their tasks effectively.
- **Task Tracking**: Within each project, users can add tasks with details including task name, description, due date, priority (low, medium, urgent), and completion status.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: All pages in the app are dynamically rendered using JavaScript, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.
- **Task Sorting**: Tasks are displayed in chronological order based on their due dates, with the earliest tasks appearing first.
- **Task Completion**: Each task includes a dynamic checkbox that allows users to mark tasks as completed, which will visually indicate completion by line-through the task card.
